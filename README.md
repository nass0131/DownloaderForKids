# DownloaderForKids

A simple and robust Android application for downloading videos and audio from YouTube and other supported sites, designed for personal use.

## Features

- **Video & Audio Download**: Supports downloading video (mp4) or audio-only (m4a, mp3) formats.
- **Format Selection**: Analyzing the URL presents a list of available video resolutions and audio qualities.
- **Background Downloading**: Downloads continue in the background with a persistent notification showing progress.
- **Automated Library Updates**: Automatically checks and updates the `yt-dlp` core library on app startup to ensure compatibility.
- **Concurrent Downloads**: Supports multiple simultaneous downloads without conflict.

## Architecture

This project follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern to ensure separation of concerns and testability.

- **View**: `MainActivity` (handling UI via **ViewBinding**).
- **ViewModel**: `MainViewModel` (manages UI state, data fetching, and business logic using `LiveData`).
- **Model (Repository)**: `YoutubeRepository` (encapsulates interactions with `YoutubeDL` library).
- **Service**: `DownloadService` (handles long-running download tasks in the foreground).
